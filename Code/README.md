This reproducibility appendix contains the technical supplement to the content of my final project. External Requirement Section sets up the computing environment by loading packages and preparing the data for analysis. In the Data Processing section, I wrote a function to select observations of interest and to recode variables from the dataset. In the Checks on Missing Pattern and Descriptive Statistics section, I computed the proportion of missing for variables of interest and calculated some descriptive statistics. The Simulations section contains the result of all my simulation studies. The Analysis section includes all model-fitting, bootstrap and additional calculations for the results I presented in the Analysis section of the paper.
